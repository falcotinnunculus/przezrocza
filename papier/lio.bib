These recent achievements can meet the demand for lightweight, cost‐effective, and/or flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices with advanced functionality and reduced manufacturing costs. This article provides a review of electronic and optoelectronic devices relying on or making use of the unique properties achievable with paper‐based materials. Basic scientific/technical principles, quantitative comparisons of material, electronic and/or optical properties, and benefits for each paper‐based application are given. Application‐specific research challenges, future design considerations, and development directions are also discussed.}, number={5}, journal={Advanced Electronic Materials}, author={Ha, Dongheon and Fang, Zhiqiang and Zhitenev, Nikolai B.}, year={2018}, month=may, pages={1700593}, language={en} }
